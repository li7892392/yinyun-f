---
**Yinyun** is a self-hosted music server with a Web player, downloads, local-library management, encrypted Windows account snapshots, and Subsonic client support.

Yinyun keeps same-server user playlist sharing and also supports cross-server exchange. The cross-server action lets you choose an expiring link or a JSON export. A public URL must be configured in the admin system settings before generating a link; JSON export remains available without it. The recipient previews local and online matches before importing a normal playlist; local files are reused when available. The exchange does not include audio files, credentials, tokens, proxies, or temporary URLs, and it does not provide LX Music client import compatibility.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> v1.5.0 uses fixed entry points: `/` for the Web player and `/admin` for the management console. The former `/music` Web route has been removed. `/api/v1`, Subsonic `/rest`, and the `/server/music` persistent audio directory are unchanged.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a personal fork of [bobcc4/yinyun-lxserver](https://github.com/bobcc4/yinyun-lxserver) with one extra feature on top of the original: **browsing local music by artist**. Everything else is identical to upstream. Upstream repository: <https://github.com/bobcc4/yinyun-lxserver>

## ✨ New in This Fork: Browse Local Music by Artist

The local music page now has a "Songs / Artists" view switch for browsing the local library by artist:

- In artist mode, the left panel lists artists with avatars and local song counts; the right side reuses the existing song list.
- Clicking an artist filters the song list to that artist's songs; clicking again clears the filter.
- Artist avatars are fetched automatically, reusing the existing `SINGER_SOURCE_PRIORITY` (`singer.sourcePriority`, default `tx,wy`, i.e. QQ Music first, then NetEase).
- New backend endpoint `POST /api/v1/player/music/local/artists` groups local tracks by artist with avatars.

| View | Display | Click behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Songs | Existing song list; filters, search, and batch actions unchanged | — |
| Artists | Left artist list (avatar, song count), right song list | Select an artist to show only their songs |

### Docker Image for This Fork

- **GitHub Packages**: `ghcr.io/li7892392/yinyun-f:latest` — includes the artist-browsing feature, built automatically by GitHub Actions on every push to the `my-artist-feature` branch. Swap the `image:` line in the examples below for this image; all other settings are unchanged.

## ✨ Web Player Key Features

### 1. Multi-platform Search and Playback

Search across major music platforms from one interface. Results can be played, favorited, or downloaded directly, with quick source and content-type filters.

<p align="center">

</p>

### 2. Local Library Management

Scan `/music` and `/cache`, including nested directories. Use quick search, advanced Boolean filters, batch selection, playlist collection, and metadata management.

</p>

### 3. Eight Quality Levels and Server Downloads

Choose from standard, high, lossless, 24-bit lossless, Hi-Res, Atmos, enhanced Atmos, and master quality. The download dialog shows the resolved file size and source platform, while server-side queues continue after the browser closes.

  <img src="docs/public/screenshots/web-download-quality.png" width="900" alt="Download quality, file size, and source platform">
</p>

### 4. Local Track Remastering

Filter and batch-select local tracks for replacement at a chosen target quality. When the target is unavailable, configurable fallback is supported and the result lists successful and failed tracks.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/public/screenshots/web-remaster.png" width="900" alt="Track remaster selection">
</p>

### 5. Player Settings and Custom Sources

Configure default quality, caching, downloads, proxies, lyrics, themes, audio effects, and playback behavior. Sidecar and embedded lyrics independently support line, word-timed, and enhanced LRC, with native TX QRC word timing. Each user can select enabled platforms per custom source, including independently configured shared sources.

</p>

### 6. Service Status and Maintenance

The dashboard summarizes connections, users, uptime, and resource usage, with direct access to data, snapshots, WebDAV, logs, and maintenance tools.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/public/screenshots/admin-dashboard.png" width="900" alt="Management dashboard">
</p>

### 7. Users and Permissions

Create and manage sync accounts, identify administrator accounts, and keep each user's playlists, settings, custom sources, cache, and download directories isolated.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/public/screenshots/admin-users.png" width="900" alt="User management">
</p>

### 8. Server Configuration

Configure access paths, Subsonic, WebDAV, cache limits, proxies, and other server options from the dashboard. Docker environment variables retain the highest priority.

</p>

### 9. Subsonic Protocol and Online Search

Connect clients such as Stream Music, LMP, and Feishin to the local library and playlists through the Subsonic API. Search supports `wy:`, `kg:`, `tx:`, `kw:`, and `mg:` platform prefixes, plus `online:` and `local:` scope prefixes.

## 🔒 Access Control & Security
The management dashboard is protected by `FRONTEND_PASSWORD`. Playlists, custom sources, downloads, and personal settings in the Web Player are authenticated through sync accounts and isolated per user. For public access, enable HTTPS and access control at the reverse proxy as well.

## 📱 Mobile Adaptation
The Web Player is deeply optimized for mobile devices, providing a native App-like experience in mobile browsers.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Built with **Node.js**, supporting multiple deployment methods.

Running from source requires Node.js `22.12.0` or later. Node.js 24 LTS is recommended.


### Option 1: Windows Client

The separate [Yinyun Windows client](https://github.com/bobcc4/yinyun-windows) connects to a server already deployed on your NAS. It signs in with the server URL, account username, and password, and keeps an encrypted local account snapshot for explicit disaster recovery. It does not start a second server on Windows.

### Option 2: Containerized Deployment via Docker

This project supports pulling images from Docker Hub or GitHub Packages:
- **Docker Hub**: `bobcc4/yinyun-lxserver:latest`
- **GitHub Packages**: `ghcr.io/bobcc4/yinyun-lxserver:latest`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The stable Docker image now uses the `latest` tag, and the former `v1` tag no longer receives updates. Existing deployments must switch to `bobcc4/yinyun-lxserver:latest`. Every stable release also keeps an immutable full-version tag, such as `bobcc4/yinyun-lxserver:v1.5.4`, for version pinning and rollback. The data layout is unchanged, so keep the existing `/server/data`, `/server/logs`, `/server/cache`, and `/server/music` mounts.

**Docker Run Example:**

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 9527:9527 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/server/data \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/server/logs \
  -v $(pwd)/cache:/server/cache \
  -v $(pwd)/music:/server/music \
  --name yinyun \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  bobcc4/yinyun-lxserver:latest
```

**Docker Compose Example:**

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  yinyun:
    image: bobcc4/yinyun-lxserver:latest
    container_name: yinyun
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "9527:9527"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/server/data
      - ./logs:/server/logs
      - ./cache:/server/cache
      - ./music:/server/music
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
      CONFIG_PATH: /server/data/config.js
```

Start the service:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Upgrade the image:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Recreating the container does not remove mounted directories. Always keep `/server/data`, `/server/logs`, `/server/cache`, and `/server/music` mounted to persistent storage.

### Option 3: Manual Run (Git Clone)

```bash
# 1. Clone project
git clone https://github.com/bobcc4/yinyun-lxserver.git && cd yinyun-lxserver

# 2. Install dependencies and build
npm ci && npm run build

# 3. Start service
npm start
```

### Option 4: Using Release Build

1. Download the archive from GitHub Releases.
2. Extract and run `npm install --production`.
3. Execute `npm start`.

### 3. Access Info

- **Web Player**: `http://your-ip:9527/`
- **Management Console**: `http://your-ip:9527/admin` (default password: `123456`)
- **Subsonic**: `http://your-ip:9527/rest`

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

Separated frontend and backend architecture based on Node.js:

- **Backend (Node.js HTTP)**: Account APIs, media processing, Subsonic, and WebDAV backup.
- **Console (Vanilla JS)**: Fixed at `/admin`, handles user and data management.
- **WebPlayer (Vanilla JS)**: Fixed at `/`, handles music playback.

## 🛡️ Data Collection & Privacy

Anonymous telemetry via PostHog is used for:

1. **Bug Tracking**: Version number and environment type.
2. **Notifications**: **Update alerts** and **maintenance notices**.

- **Totally Anonymous**: No IP, username, or playlist content is collected.
- **How to Disable**: Set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`. **Note: Disabling this prevents receiving update notifications.**
